## Ongoing Efforts

The Department of Water Resources (DWR) has been evaluating and planning for the impacts of climate change since at least 2010 and has developed a comprehensive three phase [Climate Action Plan](https://water.ca.gov/Programs/All-Programs/Climate-Change-Program/Climate-Action-Plan) that articulates how DWR is addressing climate change in the programs, projects, and activities over which it has authority.  Phase 3 of the DWR Climate Action Plan, published in 2019 and 2020, provided a vulnerability assessment and adaptation plan respectively for DWR. Phase III of the Climate Action Plan helps prioritize DWR resiliency efforts such as infrastructure improvements, enhanced maintenance and operation procedures, revised health and safety procedures, and improved habitat management and laid out additional steps needed to continue adaptation implementation.
