Long term average reserverior storage levels, in reservoirs both North and South of the Delta, is an essential metric for measuring the resiliency of the State Water Project. Reductions in average storage levels at the end of the wet season typically indicate lower flexibility in operations in the following year. This is why it is often important to look at the end of September for this particular metric.

It is also essential to look at the entire storage portfolio as a whole. Trading lower storage in North of Delta reservoirs for higher storage in South of Delta reservoirs might be an acceptable trade, depending on impacts to other metrics.
