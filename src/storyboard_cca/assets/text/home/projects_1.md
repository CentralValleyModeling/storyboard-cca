## Adaptation Strategies

The SWP climate adaptation strategies are actions taken to reduce the vulnerability of the SWP, its water users, and beneficiaries of the other benefits that the system provides to the impacts of climate change. These measures are essential for coping with the changes in temperature, precipitation patterns, sea levels, loss of snowpack, and other climatic factors that result from global warming. Climate adaptation strategies aim to enhance resilience, increase flexibility and efficiency, minimize risks, and ensure the sustainability of the SWP system and its contribution to statewide water, energy, and ecosystem management. Effective climate adaptation requires a holistic and integrated approach that considers the interconnectedness of social, economic, and environmental systems, the challenges that different changes in climate will create, and authorities and functions of the SWP. No single strategy will resolve every climate impact nor permanently resolve ever changing impacts. Because of these challenges, immediate and consistent action is needed.
