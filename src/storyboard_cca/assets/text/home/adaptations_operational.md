Operations and management measures are those that do not require significant infrastructural changes to the SWP. These changes can be achieved by investing in the way in which we manage and operate existing facilities, working with partners to facilitate operation of other facilities, using improved monitoring and scientific information, and elevating climate considerations in the planning and design of SWP operations and maintenance.
