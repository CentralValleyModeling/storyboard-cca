#### Baseline Conditions

The Delivery Capability Report presents DWR's analysis of the existing SWP system and provides important planning information for users of SWP water. The analysis provided information about how changing climate, regulatory, and operational considerations impact SWP delivery capability.

The DCR is used as the starting point for the Adaptation analyses. The DCR is a good condidate for this due to it's wide circulation, and it's consideration of existing operations, infrastructure, and climate. As such, the DCR analyses factor in all the current regulations governing SWP and CVP operations in the Delta (i.e., D-1641, 2019 BiOps and ITP), existing infrastructure and assumptions about water uses upstream in the Sacramento River and San Joaquin River watersheds.
