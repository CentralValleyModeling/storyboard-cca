### Predicting Climate Change

Several previous studies have been done that provide estimates of future climate change impacts on SWP delivery reliability.  These studies have been conducted using evolving climate data, differing analysis approaches, and different assumptions. These past studies have been fundamental to the analysis provided in this Adaptation Plan informing our understanding of how different aspects of climate change (e.g., sea level rise, earlier snowmelt, more extreme precipitation events) impact the SWP and how soon these impacts may occur. These studies are described in the [Climate Change Adapability Report](#).

The analysis in this adaptation plan builds on and complements the analysis conducted for the [2023 DCR](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/state-water-project-delivery-capability-report-dcr-2023). The 2023 DCR provides updated climate scenarios developed through a new approach ([DWR, 2023](https://data.cnra.ca.gov/dataset/d32744ae-2e11-4d6c-aa49-cc17085e4d30/resource/dffe00a6-017c-4765-affe-36b045c24969/download/risk-informed-future-climate-scenario-development-for-swp-dcr_final122023.pdf)) that employs the weather generator described above. These scenarios are used to explore and report on the SWP system impacts from climate change, but the analysis provided in the DCR assumes that no adaptation measures are implemented in its future scenarios.  The DCR highlights the impacts of climate change on the "existing" SWP system. The existing and future scenarios in the DCR, when compared, frame the water supply resiliency challenges that are expected if regulations and infrastructure remain unchanged.
