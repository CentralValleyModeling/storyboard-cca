#### Measure Impacts

The impacts described by the DCR considered the impacts of Climate Change with respect to how they effect Delivery Capability. This analysis builds on this consideration by evaluating the impact of climate change on a wider set of metrics. Each of these metrics are impacted by climate change, and they all influence the resiliency of the State Water Project. The metrics this analysis consider include:

- Reservoir Storage
- River Flows
- Delta Salinity
- SWP Deliveries

The impacts to each of these metrics are explored in this analysis. Individually, they are each important in measuring the impacts of the adaptation actions. See below for more information on each metric.
