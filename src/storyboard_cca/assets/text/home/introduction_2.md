#### Resiliency

The question that this analysis attempts to answer is: To what degree do the adaptation strategies that SWP is already planning, move SWP to a climate resilient future? Are these major adaptation strategies enough to improve SWP's resilience given the expected changes in climate? And even with these adaptation strategies, what conditions would continue to pose risks to the SWP and SWP water users?

#### Ongoing Efforts

The Department of Water Resources (DWR) has been evaluating and planning for the impacts of climate change since at least 2010 and has developed a comprehensive three phase [Climate Action Plan](https://water.ca.gov/Programs/All-Programs/Climate-Change-Program/Climate-Action-Plan) that articulates how DWR is addressing climate change in the programs, projects, and activities over which it has authority.  Phase 3 of the DWR Climate Action Plan, published in 2019 and 2020, provided a vulnerability assessment and adaptation plan respectively for DWR. Phase III of the Climate Action Plan helps prioritize DWR resiliency efforts such as infrastructure improvements, enhanced maintenance and operation procedures, revised health and safety procedures, and improved habitat management and laid out additional steps needed to continue adaptation implementation. This document is another step in DWR's ongoing efforts to refine and expand climate analysis and adaptation planning. In this analysis, five specific adaptation strategies for the SWP are evaluated and quantified:

1. Enhanced Asset Management
2. California Aqueduct Subsidence Project
3. Delta Conveyance
4. Lake Oroville flood control manual update to allow forecast Informed Reservoir Operations and
5. Increased South of Delta Storage
