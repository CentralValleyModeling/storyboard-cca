<!-- Introduction -->
The far-reaching consequences of climate change continue to impact California, necessitating the adaptation of critical infrastructure systems to ensure their resilience in the face of shifting environmental conditions.

In this analysis, over a dozen adaptation actions that the [State Water Project](https://water.ca.gov/programs/state-water-project) (SWP) is _already_ pursuing are described and explained.

In addition, five key climate adaptation strategies are quantitatively evaluated to show how these strategies, if implemented, could change the future of water supply reliability for the SWP and contribute to statewide benefits.
