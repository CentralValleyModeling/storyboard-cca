Nature based solutions are those that harness the power of nature to build resilience to future climate-driven extremes, protect communities from the climate crisis, and remove carbon from our atmosphere. These solutions may require a mix of construction and operational change but generally work by maximizing the natural capacity of the environment to improve hydrologic function, improve conditions for aquatic organisms, and rebuild degraded land.
