#### Climate Change Impacts in the DCR 2023

The Delivery Capability Report presents DWR's analysis of the existing SWP system and provides important planning information for users of SWP water. The analysis provided information about how changing climate, regulatory, and operational considerations impact SWP delivery capability.

The DCR is used as the starting point for the Adaptation analyses. The DCR is a good condidate for this due to it's wide circulation, and it's consideration of existing operations, infrastructure, and climate. As such, the DCR analyses factor in all the current regulations governing SWP and CVP operations in the Delta (i.e., D-1641, 2019 BiOps and ITP), existing infrastructure and assumptions about water uses upstream in the Sacramento River and San Joaquin River watersheds.

The most salient findings from the DCR 2023 with respect to Climate Change are:

- Under existing conditions, the estimated average annual delivery of Tabler A water for this report is 2,202 thousand acre-feet (TAF)/year.
- Under the climate change scenarios the estimated average annual delivery of Table A water is 13 percent to 22 percent lower than under existing conditions.
- Under future climate conditions, California's hydrology is likely to become more extreme with periods of high flows that current infrastructure and operations are unable to capture and longer more severe dry periods that challenge operations.
