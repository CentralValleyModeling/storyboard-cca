<h5>Adaptation Strategies</h5>
<p>The SWP climate adaptation strategies are actions taken to reduce the vulnerability of the SWP, its water users, and beneficiaries of the other benefits that the system provides to the impacts of climate change. These measures are essential for coping with the changes in temperature, precipitation patterns, sea levels, loss of snowpack, and other climatic factors that result from global warming. Climate adaptation strategies aim to enhance resilience, increase flexibility and efficiency, minimize risks, and ensure the sustainability of the SWP system and its contribution to statewide water, energy, and ecosystem management. Effective climate adaptation requires a holistic and integrated approach that considers the interconnectedness of social, economic, and environmental systems, the challenges that different changes in climate will create, and authorities and functions of the SWP. No single strategy will resolve every climate impact nor permanently resolve ever changing impacts. Because of these challenges, <strong>immediate and consistent action is needed</strong>.</p>
<p>Seventeen Adaptation Strategies are evaluated in the Report. The four presented below are those which were analytically evalutated. The remainder of this site focuses on these four strategies.</p>

    <h5>Structural Measures</h5>
    <p>Structural measures are those that require significant infrastructural changes to the SWP. This may include adding facilities or major rehabilitation or rebuilding of existing facilities. While structural measures will often require additional operational changes, these strategies are distinguished from operational and management strategies by their significant construction components. </p>

        <!-- Additional Storage -->
        <li class="list-group-item col-6">
            <h4 class="mb-1">Additional South of Delta Storage</h4>
            <p>Climate change is expected to continue amplifying Californiaâ€™s already extreme variability in precipitation and streamflow. This amplification is likely to result in more years in which high flows exist that exceed current south of Delta (SOD) storage capacity and more years in which extreme dry conditions stress the system. </p>
            <p>Additional SOD storage capacity could help allow SWP to store water in wetter years when water can be pumped safely within permit restrictions so that the water could help alleviate water supply shortages during drought conditions and potentially reduce the need for pumping in critically dry years when additional water is needed for ecological and other demands.</p>
        </li>
        <!-- Delta Conveyance Project -->
        <li class="list-group-item col-6">
            <h4 class="mb-1">Delta Conveyance Project</h4>
            <p>Delta Conveyance Project (DCP) refers to the proposed single tunnel additional point of diversion along the Sacramento River coupled with conveyance facilities in the Delta.  The Delta Conveyance Project will modernize water infrastructure in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta by making physical improvements to how SWP captures and moves water during wet years for use in dry years. The Delta Conveyance Project would add additional protection from earthquakes to the SWP and provide flexibility to manage climate-driven weather extremes.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Operations & Management</h5>
    <p>Operations and management measures are those that do not require significant infrastructural changes to the SWP. These changes can be achieved by investing in the way in which we manage and operate existing facilities, working with partners to facilitate operation of other facilities, using improved monitoring and scientific information, and elevating climate considerations in the planning and design of SWP operations and maintenance.</p>

        <li class="list-group-item col-6">
            <h4 class="mb-1">Forecast Informed Reservoir Operations</h4>    
            <p>FIRO is a flexible water management strategy that uses improved weather and runoff forecasts to help water managers retain or release water from reservoirs to increase resilience to droughts and floods. The primary objective of this FIRO project is to reduce flood risk; a secondary objective is to achieve water supply benefits where possible, while supporting environmental needs.</p>

        <!-- Voluntary Agreements  -->
        <li class="list-group-item col-6">
            <h4 class="mb-1">Agreements to Support Healthy Rivers and Lanscapes</h4>
            <p>The Agreements involve the development of projects that provide flow augmentation, modified storage releases, and non-flow actions such as floodplain inundation to enhance Delta conditions.</p>
